## NASA PHOTO OF THE DAY

https://spacedel.github.io/NasaPhotos/

## Description

We need a webpage that can pull images, and allow the user to “like” and “unlike” their favourite images.

Using the NASA api we need to fetch the data and render it on the page.

## Notes

- Need to hide api key
- Add more styling
